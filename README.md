### Project Presentation: https://youtu.be/hN-aH4XLbrQ
This video is a quick presentation of the project which also includes a demo of the iOS app and its functionalities. 

# Description

The Flight Delay Predictor is an iOS app that allows users to predict flight delays. This app displays a map of USA airports with pins and lists for selecting departure and arrival airports.The app uses a date picker to select the flight departure date and time. The prediction model was built using Python and later converted to a CoreML model to be integrated into the iOS app.The Flight Delay Predictor iOS app was built using Apple's Xcode IDE and the Swift programming language. The app uses various iOS frameworks and technologies, including MapKit for displaying the map with airport pins and lists, UIKit for building the user interface, and CoreML for integrating the machine learning model for flight delay prediction. The app also requires an active internet connection to fetch and display the airport data and flight delay predictions.

# Installation

Before installing and setting up the code, you will need the following:
•A Mac computer running macOS Catalina or later
•Xcode 13.3.1 or later installed on your Mac. You can download Xcode from the Mac App Store or from the Apple Developer website.

To install and set up the code, follow these steps:

1.Download the project zip file and unzip.

2.Open Team94Project.xcodeproj in Xcode.

3.Build and run the app on a simulator.


# Execution

1.On the initial screen, select the departure and arrival airports by tapping on the "Departure Airport:" and "Arrival Airport:" fields. That displays a new screen to select the airport.
